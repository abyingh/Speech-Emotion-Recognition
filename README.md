In this project, **cross-linguistic speech emotion recognition** is aimed. For this purpose, emotional data of different languages (English, Lithuanian, German, Spanish, Serbian, and Polish) are used. From the uttturences in these languages, the feature extraction process are performed. Some 2D feature spaces such as **cochleagrams, spectrograms, mel cepstrograms, and fractal dimension-based space** are employed as emotional features of the speech. A CNN framework built with Keras is used as a decision system.
